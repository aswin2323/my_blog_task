            <strong>Who was William Shakespeare?</strong>
        </main>
        <section>
            <h2>An Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                William Shakespeare was a renowned English poet, playwright, and actor
                born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. His birthday is most commonly
                celebrated on 23 April (see When was Shakespeare born), which is also
                believed to be the date he died in 1616. <br />

                Shakespeare was a prolific writer during the Elizabethan and Jacobean
                ages of British theatre (sometimes called the English Renaissance or
                the Early Modern Period). <u>Shakespeare’s plays</u> are perhaps his
                most enduring legacy, but they are not all he wrote.
                <u>Shakespeare’s poems</u>
                also remain popular to this day.
            </p>
            <h3>Shakespeare's Family Life</h3>
            <p>
                Records survive relating to William Shakespeare’s family that offer an
                understanding of the context of Shakespeare's early life and the lives
                of his family members.
                <mark>
                    <u> John Shakespeare married Mary Arden </u>
                </mark>
                , and together they had eight children. John and Mary lost two
                daughters as infants, so William became their eldest child. John
                Shakespeare worked as a glove-maker, but he also became an important
                figure in the town of Stratford by fulfilling civic positions. His
                elevated status meant that he was even more likely to have sent his
                children, including William, to the local grammar school. <br />
                William Shakespeare would have lived with his family in their house on
                Henley Street until he turned eighteen. When he was eighteen,
                <u><mark> married Anne Hathaway</mark></u>, who was twenty-six. It was a rushed marriage because Anne
                was
                already pregnant at the time of the ceremony. Together they had three
                children. Their first daughter, <u>Susanna</u>, was born six months
                after the wedding and was later followed by twins <u>Hamnet</u> and
                <u>Judith</u>. Hamnet died when he was just 11 years old.
            </p>
            <h4>Shakespeare's Works</h4>
            <p>
                Altogether Shakespeare's works include 38 plays, 2 narrative poems,
                154 sonnets, and a variety of other poems. No original manuscripts of
                Shakespeare's plays are known to exist today. It is actually thanks to
                a group of actors from Shakespeare's company that we have about half
                of the plays at all. They collected them for publication after
                Shakespeare died, preserving the plays. These writings were brought
                together in what is known as the First
                <u><mark>Folio</mark></u> ('Folio' refers to the size of the paper
                used). It contained 36 of his plays, but none of his poetry. <br />
                <ins>Shakespeare’s legacy</ins> is as rich and diverse as his work;
                his plays have spawned countless adaptations across multiple genres
                and cultures. His plays have had an enduring presence on stage and
                film. His writings have been compiled in various iterations of The
                Complete Works of William Shakespeare, which include all of his plays,
                sonnets, and other poems. William Shakespeare continues to be one of
                the most important literary figures of the English language.

            <h5>New Place; a home in Stratford-upon-Avon</h5>
            <p>
                Shakespeare’s success in the London theatres made him considerably
                wealthy, and by 1597 he was able to purchase New Place, the largest
                house in the borough of <u>Stratford-upon-Avon</u>. Although his
                professional career was spent in London, he maintained close links
                with his native town. <br />
                Recent archaeological evidence discovered on the site of
                <u>Shakespeare’s New Place</u> shows that Shakespeare was only ever an
                intermittent lodger in London. This suggests he divided his time
                between Stratford and London (a two or three-day commute). In his
                later years, he may have spent more time in Stratford-upon-Avon than
                scholars previously thought. <br />
                On his father's death in 1601, William Shakespeare inherited the old
                family home in Henley Street part of which was then leased to tenants.
                Further property investments in Stratford followed, including the
                purchase of 107 acres of land in 1602. <br />
                <mark> died in Stratford-upon-Avon on 23 April 1616</mark> at the age
                of 52. He is buried in the sanctuary of the parish church, Holy
                Trinity.

    He always ensured that the protagonists of his plays were never Perfect. 
    They were always portrayed a little evil in the protagonists and justified the antagonists actions.

    Yeah, it’s worth reading them, but they’re a pretty hard read, and 
    you need to have a fair idea of how to turn a script into a play.

        Oh wait, you wanted MY critique of SHAKESPEARE’S writing.
        He was still the greatest English writer last time I checked. I don’t think that’s likely to change.

    William Shakespeare remains the finest writer in the English language. 
    He does have seconds, but Shakespeare’s first place in English is secure.
